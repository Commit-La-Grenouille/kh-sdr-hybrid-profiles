# ESD profiles to use for hybrid meeting usage

## Introduction

Kingdom Halls are now reopened but are holding meetings in hybrid mode (in the hall + live on Zoom).

The point of this repo is to gather profiles that could prove useful to manage the medias & Zoom part of the meeting.

## Repo structure

All profiles should be stored in the proper top-level folder based on the number of buttons of the device (and not the number of buttons used).

Then within each, the profile (and any profile-unique element) should be stored in a combo folder with a README.md to explain why and what.

To foster reusability (icons, scripts...), you can either/or:

* store icons/scripts in the top-level shared folders
* use symlinks to reuse the content from another location in the repo
